#### A tool to analyze and implement various image steganography methods

"Steganography is the art and science of communicating in a way which hides the existence of the
communication. In contrast to Cryptography, where the enemy is allowed to detect, intercept and modify
messages without being able to violate certain security premises guaranteed by the cover message with
the embedded cryptosystem. The goal of Steganography is to hide messages inside other harmless
messages in a way that does not allow any enemy to even detect that there is a second message
present". In image steganography the information is hidden exclusively in images.

#### Application of Image Steganography

Steganography is employed in various useful applications, e.g. secret communication among agencies /
people, copyright control of materials, enhancing robustness of image search engines and smart IDs
(identity cards) where individuals’ details are embedded in their photographs. Other applications are
video-audio synchronization, companies’ safe circulation of secret data, TV broadcasting, TCP/IP packets
(for instance a unique ID can be embedded into an image to analyze the network traffic of particular
users). In steganography many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most
popular because of their frequency on the Internet.
